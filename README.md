# 🚀 DevMatchAI

DevMatchAI is a full-stack platform designed to help developers receive real-time code reviews, feedback, and collaborative development suggestions. It begins as a robust web application, and will soon evolve to incorporate AI/ML capabilities for intelligent feedback and automated suggestions.

## 🧠 Overview

> The goal is to create an ecosystem that connects developers, reviews their code, and eventually enhances the development workflow using AI.

DevMatchAI currently allows:
- Running a test API to ensure backend/frontend communication
- Clean architecture for scaling APIs
- Preparedness for AI integrations (code summarization, auto-reviews, etc.)
